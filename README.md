# APPLICATION OF FP GROWTH ALGORITHM IN THE RECOMMENDATION OF NEW ARTISTS FOR USER

## I. Project Summary
This research was done to recommend/forecast which artist labels people are interested in, by analyzing trends in the listening behaviors of radio listenersâ€™ datasets using FP Growth, one pf Association mining algorithms

## II. Dataset Description
The domain of the dataset is related to music. The lastfm dataset used for the study has 289955 records across 4 columns (user, artist, sex, and country). The lastfm dataset was examined using a common data mining and modeling methodology. 

## III. Methodology
The methodology for this project involved applying four techniques within the big data analytics lifecycle. These techniques include: 
#### 1.) Data Preprocessing 2.) Exploratory Analysis 3.) Data Visualization 4.) Association Rule Mining using FP Growth Algorithm
