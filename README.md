# APPLICATION OF FP GROWTH ALGORITHM IN THE RECOMMENDATION OF NEW ARTISTS FOR USER

#Abstract

Getting useful insights from a large amount of data collected and stored in databases across various fields involves the use of some data science processes. 
Association mining is one of the widely used techniques in finding frequent patterns (Frequent Itemset), associations, and correlations among datasets. 
In this paper, a lastfm dataset containing the history of various artists that different users are listening to in their different countries. 
The dataset has 289955 rows with 4 features. Python and spark were used to analyze and explore the dataset. 
An unsupervised Machine learning algorithm called the FP-Growth algorithm was used in the study to make recommendations for users based on the artists they were listening to.
70% dataset split was used to train the algorithm. 
1688 was recorded as the frequent itemset/pattern noticed in the dataset and 487 association rules. 
The 30% test dataset was used to make predictions for the users.
